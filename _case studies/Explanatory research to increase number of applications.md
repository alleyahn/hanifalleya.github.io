# **Background**

As a job marketplace, Glints need to satisfy both side of the market: job seekers and employers. Job seekers need to find jobs and employers need to find the best employee. In a perfect world, employers will want to hire anyone they find right away. In reality, they need to find enough candidates to be able to make a hiring decision, since not every candidate applying to their job posts perfectly fits the requirement. In the end, a sufficient number of applications is essential for retaining employers on the platform.

**How might we increase the number of jobs receiving X number of applications in Y weeks?**

I conducted explanatory research to find out the current condition of supply and demand in the platform and validating assumptions on number of applications.

# Research Goals

1. Understand what kind of jobs receive more than X applications in Y weeks.
2. Validate assumptions pertaining to factors contributing to the number of applications
3. Come up with suggestions to increase the number of jobs that receive more than X applications

# Timeline

The overall process took about two weeks. I did all the planning, recruitment, data gathering, synthesis, analysis, and reporting.

# Methodology

- Quantitative: descriptive statistics using PostgreSQL, correlational statistics using SPSS, data gathering using Amplitude.
- Qualitative: desk research on extreme samples of jobs with the highest and lowest number of jobs, investigating their characteristics and attributes

# Research Process

### Planning

This phase involves talking to stakeholders, in this case Product Managers, on their goals and assumptions. I decided to put more emphasis on quantitative methods since they can answer the research goals better. However, I still incorporate qualitative investigation to complement the quantitative data.

### Data Gathering

There are at least three data sources where I could derive insights on the number of applications per job. They are:

### Synthesis

After data had been gathered, I went into synthesis mode. In this phase, the focus was to conduct descriptive analysis on the current condition at the time, find correlations between some variables to the number of jobs, and compare best versus worst performing job posts.
