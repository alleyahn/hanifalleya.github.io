This is how I feel right now. The future is still a blur for me. I don't have the confidence to walk on. So here I am. Sitting on the road. Enjoying what is there to see, hear, and feel.  
  
I wish I have a company to sit beside me, but, no. People seem to walk through the fog without knowing what is going to happen. No one in the world knows what is going to happen in a few seconds later. But still, I'm anxious.  
  
I observe those people. Their reckless actions, their optimism, their choice to get lost in the fog.  
  
Maybe they know what is there, in the fog. Maybe they pretend they know. Maybe someone told them what to do. Maybe they bring flashlights with them.  
  
Sometimes I hear stories from people who pass me by, about those people. Some have good lucks. Some have bad lucks. Some have a second chance. Some ended with happiness. Some ended in misery.  
  
So, maybe I'm going to sit here until someone tell me what to do. Until someone give me flashlight. Until I have no choice but pretend I know.  
  
But I'm sure one day I'll walk this road 'till the end to see what is on the other side. Alone or with a company, that doesn't matter. Because in the end, I'll be buried alone.  
yours,  
  
Alline.
