## What's New in Version 2X.0


- **Improved failure tolerance level**: Due to increased exposure to failure and new insights, Alleya is now more likely to take even more uncomfortable paths and act even more spontaneously.

- **Refined Taste Bud functionality**:
Extensive hours spent sampling different types of tea have significantly honed Alleya's ability to identify subtle flavours. She is less likely to describe food and beverages as "yummy" and is more likely to use more appropriate descriptors.

- **Enhanced spice tolerance**: Devouring spicy tteokbokki or *cumi cabai hijau* now doesn't always result in diarrhoea. However, please note that *cengek* is still out of the question. *Bon app√©tit!*

- **Enhanced Migraines management**: Successfully identified the root causes of migraines. New preventive strategies have been deployed, considerably lowering Panadol Extra consumption and significantly enhancing overall life quality.

- **Bolder lip options available**: Alleya is now more accepting of applying lipstick in one full swipe and more open to other lip colours besides burnt orange or brick red.


## Bug Fixes

- **Removed "changing clothes" as a logical consequence of taking a shower**: enhanced life experience has allowed Alleya to proactively take a shower midday when the weather gets hot, improving overall mood. 

- **Reduced fear of white colour**: Apprehension towards white items has now been lowered due to acceptance of normal signs of wear, resulting in increased purchases of the items. Thanks to [Rajiv Surendra](https://youtube.com/watch?v=ClAqiBqqtu0) for fixing this bug.

## Known Issues
- Occasionally, Alleya might experience nostalgia pangs or moments of 'staircase wit' from earlier versions. Temporary and mostly harmless. 

- Overthinking Engine might still activate under stress; further optimisation is scheduled for the next update.

## Coming Soon

- Healthier + enhanced frugal lifestyle (for real this time, amen)
