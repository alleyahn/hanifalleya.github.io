My brother’s wedding day is approaching. This is, like any other life events, is inevitable. I knew that this day is coming. Well, it was unthinkable for me to help a boy who spends his time playing PlayStation with his wedding. Now, I’m taking a break from helping him with the invitation. He asked me to write some names and print them onto adhesive labels. 

The invitation is designed by his ex, which is the only ex he has. I find it funny. This reminds me that God’s plan is unpredictable. The person you love today, may not be standing beside you on your wedding day. That person may be present, but as the designer of your invitation, or a band player, or a mere guest. That person you hate to death? Yeah, he has a fair chance of standing by you as your groom. But, that’s life, isn’t it? It always goes the way you don’t want it to, but sometimes it gives you sweet surprises that last a lifetime. 

My brother is one wonderful man. Whoever gets to marry him is one lucky girl. He’s devoted to our family, loves children, funny, and he has a golden heart. Additionally, he has a stable job. I love him so much that I’m crying like rn while writing this. He is a living proof that prayers are heard, and that dreams don’t die easily. 

I can only wish the best for him. Because he deserves it.
