The year was 2010. 
It was the year when I climbed a mountain,  
then fell into its crater.  
I didn’t know it was actually a volcano  
until lava seeped into my bones.  
Bruno Mars would sing, “too young too dumb to realize.”

I almost died. In fact, I was dying.  
But the heat that wrapped me up, transformed me into someone else.

Tbc.
