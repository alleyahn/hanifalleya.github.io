I have "becoming an influential researcher" on my bucket list. So, I'm actively on the look out for media that could help improve my communication skill, especially in the context of my role as a UX Researcher. I'll be sharing what I consume in the form of "reviews" a la HI hehe, albeit in a less-academic manner. Turned out it was a great format to reflect what I've read and expand my knowledge on a certain topic.

Ok, first entry.

A few days ago, I accidentally tapped on a [Stanford GSB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_c9wwfh9i0&t=1115s) video thumbnail on YouTube. The guest speaker was Kelly McGonigal, a lecturer at Stanford GSB. She talked about how feeling nervous before public speaking is actually a good sign. This bit is not really new to me. However, she then touched upon the topic of communicating research. So, I kept tuning in.

McGonigal gave three tips on communicating research:

1. talk about the crunchy, real, non-abstract details of research,

3. invite and allow audience to develop their own thoughts, and

5. walk through audience through data

**First** tip, refrain from talking about the research in abstract. This is especially true if your audience is not as knowledgable as you are on the topic. In my context, this means people outside of my squad. Other tribes, teams outside of GovTech. Artefacts such as photos, videos, audio samples are your best friends. They will help the audience understand the research (and your point) better.

**Second,** the goal of your communication is to have your audience develop their own experience and thoughts about your research. McGonigal, who helps PhD students to communicate their research, observed that her students have the tendency to show that they are right. This manifest into talking too fast to hide their weakness or not accepting questions. She believed when communicating our research, we need to do our best for the audience segment we care the most (since we can't please everyone!). Talking at the speed of lighting or avoiding questions prevent your audience to digest the new information.

**Third,** avoid relying solely on the phrase "as you can see..." without giving a proper explanation. It's okay to show data in our presentation. However, we need to remember that our audience didn't participate in the research with us. It is safe to assume that they don't see what we see. So, always explain charts or numbers, even though we \*think\* it doesn't need explanation.

Out of the three tips, the second and third ones resonate with me the most. Why? Because I admit I do that a lot haha. As a researcher, I have my fair share of insecurities. After days of fieldwork and hours of report making, I start questioning myself and the result. Wishing that I'd done things differently. (Wait, this starts to sound like a breakup letter...) Anyway! McGonigal said to have some conviction and stand behind your research. That's true. In the end, insecurity drives improvements and innovations :)

Also, in presentations I use "as you can see" because I thought giving a walkthough would waste time. My colleagues (a.k.a. my audience, most of the time) are smarter than me! Well, turned out this is NG. A good middle ground would be sharing the document before D-day so that everyone can read, digest, and ask questions asynchronously in their own time. I guess that would make the actual walkthrough a bit easier. Actually, my team has been doing this. My homework then is to take my sweet time explain the data. Eh, but what about the time limit?

Perhaps to treat presentations as "snacks" we use to lure our audience to read the whole report. [CLOSER UK](https://learning.closer.ac.uk/learning-modules/research-communications/how-to-maximise-the-impact-of-your-research/think-innovatively/)'s guide on research communications features this "wedding cake" approach. Basically, it recommends to develop different outputs for different audiences and contexts.

This wedding cake approach requires cherry-picking your data in presentation and leaving those not relevant for our audience in the full report. It's ok to explain your data, but pick only the most impactful ones, I guess!

Overall, I enjoyed this 26 minute podcast. This reminds me to always putting the audience first in my communication and be intentional about it.
