Spotify recommended me Beenzino's song I've never heard before. It's titled If I Die Tomorrow. It made me want to write these words.

What if after this non-sugared cup of coffee  
my life unravels slowly  
As I stroll under the 4pm sunlight  
Thinking it might be last time I bathe in gold

I remember the smell of the bookstore  
My father used to take me to  
The two of us against mountains of books  
He watched over me while I ran through aisles

Sleeping at noon in my mom's cuddle  
I used to count to a hundred before sneaking away  
Now between all this hustle  
I wish I was her daughter who obey

Big sis, I always misunderstand her  
Her mind is a place I've never been  
What does love mean to her?  
Why did she marry the man who thinks mom's mean?

My big brother watched me cried one day  
He said I can't always be a victor  
Yet without bother, he stayed  
Washed away my sorrow over dinner

If I die tomorrow, I know my life isn't my own  
I hope the rain will hit the roof  
Wash away all sorrow, make my presence known  
So mother know I am in every drop

Will I be able to answer the questions?  
About who I pray to?  
About what was let through between these lips?  
About what I've seen with these two eyes?

If I die tomorrow,  
in the end life is a tunnel  
Which I walk alone  
.  
.  
.  
right?
