I wonder why my younger self was really curious about her future...? Well. Aren't we all? Can't blame her. Today I've [found another letter I wrote](https://deeperconvs.wordpress.com/2009/05/20/hi-alline/), this time from 2009. Again, I feel like I have to answer her questions because now I have the answers.

Hi, Alline.

Well, I do like it that I found your letter. Now I wonder why you said that I don't like remembering the past? But, yes, I am willing to walk down the memory lane with you and see what you have to tell me.

Yes, I am well aware that you have so many dreams to realise and you want me (older you) to be someone so cool. In my previous letter, I have informed you that I am not those things. I am not a journalist, photographer, musician (btw it's confirmed that we're not gifted in that area), or a graphic designer. Well, I still do graphic design jobs on the side but it is nothing to be proud of.

And nope, I am not a doctor. In senior high school, we failed Physics and Maths. We got into the social sciences program, but it is nothing to be ashamed/regretted about. But yes, we got into UI... Depok. Aha, I reckon that you might think that you do not think we're gonna make good doctor, right? We actually got into IR, diambil dengan penuh kesadaran dan tanggung jawab. No, I wasn't forced to take this major, even though sometimes I did hope I could major in Psychology instead.

Oh, that's bad. I don't remember about that tragedy but today is the announcement of the Constitutional Court's rule on Prabowo's petition. Who's Prabowo? Yeah he's the guy who ran the election against the incumbent. Long story short, I know you're not interested in politics, but he has been causing quite a scene for the last few years.

Ahh, I remember that I used to listen to classical music. Komang introduced you to it, right? Yes I still listen to some of them, they're still in my Spotify library. Yes, sister. We stream music now. We're no longer pirating music. And yes, I still have Bjork in my library.

... Actually, about the saxophone... \*nervous laugh\*... We stopped before we become any good. It's still there, on the top of our bookshelf, untouched. Mom has told me to sell it, but I hesitate.. We're better at playing guitar, tho! :) We now can follow tabs, quite good enough la to post cover on Instagram heheh.

Also, about photography. I think we were only following the trend when you mentioned "hasrat fotografi", right? But, yeah, I still enjoy taking pictures with my phone! :)

Ok, and why do you assume that I would get paid for designing? Do you think we're _that_ good? Hmm, we do get freenlance jobs from time to time, so I guess that's enough for us. And yes, I definitely remember designing Multiply templates! :D We used Photoscape back then, right? And you're right! It's no longer Photoshop CS. It's CC now!

"Pasti di zaman kamu hidup udah gaul abis."

I'm not sure about that sentence but it's getting hotter because of global warming. Even the air in Jakarta is so polluted now. If John Titor really does exist, he would avoid this time period at all cost. Unless he could do something about it.

Ok and who's Ernest Cokelat? I had to google him first to get what you mean. And for God's sake, that senior we had a crush on was (and is) way better that Ernest Cokelat, okay! Hahaha. Aaand no, as of now I don't have a boyfriend. Sorry to disappoint you. But we did kinda have one for a short period of time. Haha.

I'm still in touch with some of the people you mentioned! I follow Thia on Instagram, I still occasionally talk to Kak Komang, I still follow Bang Beet aka Jaka Haris on all social media platforms. Kak Kiya, Mas Dim, and Kak Op, too. I'm not sure about Kak Rhesa. I wonder how he's doing now? I think he went to ITB?

Yes, I remember about Egide Muhire. I've googled his name once in a while but got no result. I hope he's okay!

And no, we're still in Jakarta. Even though I'd love to move to Bandung. Yes, Jakarta's traffic is still the worst but now we have more decent public transport!!! :) You will like it better now!

Aahh our family. Palu fell sick a few years ago. Don't worry, you're doing fine all this time. Yes, mum still likes yoghurt, but not _that_ much. Yes, Mbak Finka already gave birth to two daughters! The oldest one likes to bug you when she comes over hahah. She's smart, tho. And I'm not sure about who you were referring to, but he married to Kak Rira now and they have a son.

Don't worry, Alleya. You will have more privacy as you grow older. But yeah, your family still reads your diary from time to time. And yeah, she's still that over-protective. Even to me, a grown ass woman. She's been telling me to get married every time I come home late hahah. She loves us, and I guess scolding is her love language...?

We're still writing, but not novels. Haha. Reports. Question lists. Research proposal. I do still get extra pocket money from the book we wrote back in 2008. I thank my younger selves for giving me extra money to watch movies and buy skincare products :)

Aaah yes! Please send my love to Miss Menik! Without her we won't be here today! :) Tell her that she got beautiful children! :)

Hahahah, no worries. I'm working remotely today. No boss around. But sure, I do have things to take care of, reports to write, and interviews to generate insights from. :)

It was nice reading your letter, Alline.

Please live your best life, okay?

See ya!

\-Alline.
