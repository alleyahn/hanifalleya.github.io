A few days ago, I had to attend a meeting with my academic adviser. The new semester is coming. I will get to write my literature review required for graduating. For me, this semester will be my last semester.

But for my most of my friends, the new semester is non-existent. They will have their graduation at the end of the month. I will be there, not wearing toga. Just normal, casual clothes. 

As I was walking through the trees, glancing upon the lake, I felt like everything's dull. I felt empty, knowing that I was not on my way to my _Kos_ room. I felt empty, knowing that I was not a sophomore. I felt empty, knowing that I didn't have anyone to meet that evening. No one was taking me out to dinner at a nearby Warteg or cafe. No study session was scheduled that evening. 

Those trees and lakes I saw that day were the same trees and lake I've seen almost every day since my freshman year. But somehow, that day they looked dull to me. Maybe I'd been seeing them through rose-tinted glass. A year ago, seeing them made me happy, knowing there were so many things to look out for. That day, they made me feel empty.

I've told this to a friend of mine, and I said that I was fine. I _am_ fine. But maybe, deep inside, I am not okay. I fear that people who are dear to me will be drifting away from me. My closest friends are my anchor, they keep me grounded. I want to keep them close.

_This,_ is a change in my life that I'm terrified of.

As I grow older, making new friends is getting harder. Investing emotions and time into a relationship is no longer something I do lightly. In fact, I have made a list contains name of people I want to keep in touch with. Most of them are from college. 

I knooow. I know people come and go and graduations are always about goodbye. But I've never been this sad about it. Graduations in primary school, junior high, or high school always got me excited. But not this one. Damn. If you are my close friends and you're reading this, just know that I **_love_** u so much ok?

Okay, I've stopped crying. Maybe I should stop writing. This has been a tissue post. Uhhh, post I write to make me stop crying. Lol. Okay. Bye. Maybe I will post stuff from my summer holiday next time!!!
