I’ve always been good at reading people.

So, of course, I was right about what I felt when I first saw you. You were chubby and short. No one will ever look at you. But I’ve had a crush on you, since the first day.  

I’ve always been good at reading people.

So, of course, I know if you’re lying or not. Not only good at reading people, _especially you_, I read a lot of books. So, I know the reasons behind your lies you’ve told me. And I’m okay with them.

I’ve always been good at reading people.  

So, of course, I knew that when you drifted away from me, I know it was for someone else. Of course I was right. You later told me that you liked that girl who had everything I didn’t. Of course I said I’d cheer for you from behind.

I’ve always been good at reading people.

But why can’t I read that person in the mirror? Why can’t I tell why is that person crying so hard that she fell on her knees?
