at least by Asian.  
  
Because K-Pop is highly influenced by western pop. Let's just say that western pop has various style, from AA-ZZ. We don't enjoy ALL those styles, right? We have our preferences, certain favorite styles, AC; DB; GF; and so on. Korean and, let's say Indonesian, have similar taste (please remember this equation: korean's taste = Indonesian taste). Proven from how Indosiar shows K-Drama since my sister was still in high school 'till now. Korean musicians, I think, create K-Pop songs that influenced by their certain favorite western pop style. Voila, KT=IT.
