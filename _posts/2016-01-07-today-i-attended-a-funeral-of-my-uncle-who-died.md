Today, I attended a funeral of my uncle who died on his wife’s birthday. He had been ill for a year and half, complications of various diseases. Before he got ill, it was his wife who got sick. He stayed by her side until she completely recovered.

When I saw his wife today, she was all smile. She did look sad a few times but I didn’t see her cry.

It struck me that… hmmm… that marriage is not a simple thing. Being a wife or a husband is a lifetime commitment to your partner. You vow to be responsible of each other for the rest of your lives.

  
Will I be capable of loving someone that greatly?

Or, even,

do I deserve love that great?
