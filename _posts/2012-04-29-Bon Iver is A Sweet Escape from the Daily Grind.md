Do you ever feel like you want to run away from daily routines but unfortunately you can't? Do you ever want to refresh your soul without ever leaving your room? Well, here's a thing about music-- it heals you, anytime and anywhere.

Take a chance to listen to Bon Iver, who just grabbed this year's Grammy for Best Alternative Album and Best New Artist. Their self-titled album consists of 10 songs, including "Holocene", "Perth", and "Beth/Rest".

The music in this album is relaxing yet makes your imagination run wildly. When I listen to "Holocene" for the first time, I felt like I was floating. So authentic and very detailed, you will be amazed when you pay attention to it. Good companion while waiting or brainstorming.

Bon Iver offers you a magnificent musical journey. They will take you over the Australian sky with "Perth", bring you back to the 1980s with "Beth/Rest", and sing you a lullaby called "Wash". The lyrics are also poetic, a few of them are almost like random ramblings, but still beautiful.

This album is quite different from their last album "For Emma". Their sophomore album is richer in sound, more instruments are included. Justin Vernon's voice will always be loved. He is one of the singers who use Auto-Tune for a good reason. It will haunt you and make you want to listen to it again and again.

If you ever found yourself craving for ideas, take an hour to enjoy videos of Bon Iver's self-titled album on their Youtube channel. Yes, you are welcome.
