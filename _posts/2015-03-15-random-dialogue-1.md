Boy:I'll eventually regret nothing. Ya, setidaknya, itu tujuan hidup gue. To regret nothing. Girl: Is that even possible? I've seen people regretting their whole lives. Boy: That won't be me. Girl: How are you planning to do it? Boy: See, I've made stupid mistakes. All I have to do is to learn from those mistakes. That way, my regrets will vanish into thin air.
