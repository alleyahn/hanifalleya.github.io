## What's New in Version 28.0

- **Bolder lip options available**: Alleya is now more accepting of applying lipstick in one full swipe and more open to other lip colours besides burnt orange or brick red.

- **Improved failure tolerance level**: Due to increased exposure to failure and new insights, Alleya is now more likely to take even more uncomfortable paths and act spontaneously.

- **Enhanced spice tolerance**: Devouring spicy tteokbokki or *cumi cabai hijau* now doesn't always result in diarrhoea. However, please note that *cengek* is still out of the question. *Bon app√©tit!*

- **Migraine Management Enhancement**: Successfully identified the root causes of migraines. New preventive strategies have been deployed, considerably lowering Panadol Extra consumption and significantly enhancing overall life quality.

## Bug Fixes

- **Removed "changing clothes" as a logical consequence of taking a shower**: enhanced life experience has allowed Alleya to proactively take a shower midday when the weather gets hot, improving overall mood. 

## Known Issues
- Occasionally, Alleya might experience nostalgia pangs or moments of 'staircase wit' from earlier versions. Temporary and mostly harmless. 

- Overthinking Engine might still activate under stress; further optimisation is scheduled for the next update.

## Coming Soon

- Healthier + More Frugal Lifestyle (for real this time, amen)
